## About

SuperFluo is a Rubik's cube timer with some additional features normally not found in the space. For the most part is the same as most timers out there, but there's a key difference. The different idea with this timer is to record the user's webcam while solving the cube, capturing the whole solve. In addition to recording the solve, it will overlay the scramble and the timer into a shareable video.
